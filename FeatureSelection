The central premise when using a feature selection technique is that the data contains many features that are either 
redundant or irrelevant, and can thus be removed without incurring much loss of information.
Redundant or irrelevant features are two distinct notions, since one relevant feature may be redundant in 
the presence of another relevant feature with which it is strongly correlated.

Feature selection techniques should be distinguished from feature extraction.
Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, 
whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features. Feature selection techniques are often used in 
domains where there are many features and comparatively few samples (or data points).
